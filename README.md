## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>


This project facilitates proctoring targeted practice sessions on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). It allows you and your friends to create custom mashup contests using problems from the Codeforces problem set that are unsolved by all participants.

Additionally, it offers the option to select the number of questions you need and the difficulty level of each question, randomized from the set of all unsolved problems.

In the background, the application utilizes the [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) web scraper to gather data from the Codeforces [mashup](https://codeforces.com/mashup/new) site, automatically filling in information based on user input.

Take a look at the project ...
